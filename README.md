# Happy-Cat
Python Gui where users can play and feed with Pusheen to make her stay alive. 

#Getting Started 
You will need to install Python 3. Run StayAlive.py to open the Gui and press enter to start playing. To feed Pusheen, press the "Feed" button and to play with Pusheen, press the "Play" button. Try to keep her happy but not feeding her too much, otherwise it will make her food-baby or playing with her too much, otherwise she will get tired. 

This is my first github project and is inspired by my boyfriend Simon, who in a way, is exactly like Pusheen.
